Site allows hate speech about LGBT people	http://nola.com/forums/soundoff	en-US	A website I frequent that is a hot bed for racist and bigoted comments allowed a user to post the following. 326621.5.2.1. Homosexuals are perverts by oflguy139, 04/28/16 3:32 PM Re: will the house rename the "hastert rule"? by fatnhappy6, 04/28/16 3:32 PM that is not hate, it is a fact of course this is hate speech and their rules forbid this kind of speech. But this comments as well as others are never removed when reported to moderators of the site. In fact only the responses shouting down hate speech on this site are removed by moderators. The hate speech is always allowed to remain.	D C, Other country April 28 at 8:48 pm	nola, nolaom, lgbt, hate
17 yearl old boy beaten because he declared himself equal to a non-Roma	https://www.dropbox.com/s/1usdkdte1qmp8q3/Roma%20incident_Bulgaria%202016_ENG%20subs%20updated.mp4?dl=0	bg-BG	Mitko, a 17 year-old boy was beaten last weekend because he declared himself equal to a non-Roma man who threatened him. This was an attack on all Roma. This is not an exception; it is a predictable peak in the ordinary racism we face, and a symptom of the hate crimes, and other forms of discrimination, we experience every day in Bulgaria and elsewhere. When we say we don’t enjoy equality, our non-Roma brothers and sisters often don’t believe us. They are blind to their own privilege, and still perceive us as the ones who need to do something more. They don’t see the prejudice, only its effects, and conclude that we are passive and unmotivated. They do not know how hard it is to declare yourself equal when so many say you are not; they cannot imagine what it is to be beaten just because you say what Mitko did. Mitko knows, I know, and many of our Roma children, women and men know; and many more know what it is to silence themselves to avoid the same beating. Watch this video. It is painful, but it shows the brutal deprivation of our dignity and human rights. My organisation is closely watching how the Bulgarian authorities investigate this case, and if they show anything less than the closest scrutiny to this act of racial hatred, we will make sure they are condemned in Europe and around the world. But we all need to do more. We need to show solidarity, we need to show support. We are all Mitko, Roma and non-Roma. We are equal!

Scuze comunităţii evreieşti pentru colindul antisemit de la Cluj / Apologies to the Jewish community for the anti-Semitic carol in Cluj	http://www.rfi.ro/politic-75270-scuze-comunit-ii-evreie-ti-pentru-colindul-antisemit-de-la-cluj	ro-RO	In December 2013, on the occasion of the relaunching of the TVR 3 (public TV station), two carols have been selected as well to be broadcast, among which there was also a carol that dated more than a century before. The lyrics of this one carol contained pejorative appellations addressed to the Jewish community. The public TV station was fined and the then director of the Cluj County Centre for Preserving and Promoting Traditional Culture expressed his apologies, confessing that he had proposed the two carols to be broadcast based on the fact that they were short enough, without realizing the message they were sending. He publicly apologized for the offence against the Jewish community and mentioned that nobody had had the intention of insulting the Jewish people. The then foreign minister said the took note of the event, with "concern and indignation" and mentioned that it's not acceptable for antisemitism to continue to be a reality in the 21st century. He also mentioned that he's waiting all the specialized institutions to investigate, sanction and take measures to prevent such regrettable situations. The Orthodox Church itself expressed its disagreement towards situations that incite to religious or ethnic hatred or antisemitism, highlighting that Romanian Orthodox carols cannot be used to spread hatred between people.

To describe it, I will use the description that is on his own website written by antifacists activists in other media. For instance, Colin Cortbus, journalist of the Huffington Post: “National Action uses evocative, professional-quality graphics, focusing on brutally racist, emotional and symbolic imagery of violent struggle, accompanied by carefully crafted, concise, ideology-centred textual messages and memorable slogans… this material can have a fundamentally different effect on young, often socially-isolated, predominantly male-youths who have already accepted the racist and violent premises of extreme nationalism. It can provide a perverse identity-giving discourse of perceived empowerment, superiority, meaning, elitism, and ‘coolness’; A discourse that drives them into becoming activists rather than merely keyboard sympathisers or online trolls.” The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson said: “Their views are so extreme and utterly noxious that they make the BNP look like Amnesty International.”	S SL, Spain September 23, 2015 at 11:36 am	britain, english, nationalism, violence, fascism

Az Ultrasliberi viszont ennek ellenére sem adta fel, így harmadjára is megjelentek, én viszont nem voltam rest, harmadjára is jelentettem és ezzel fel is adták.

The article begins by saying that Islam is hostile to the Western civilization, and cites Dawid Woods' thought that Western countries are actively promoting sharia, because they put Islam above other religions, and allow Islam to treat [Western] people as second-class citizens. It also states that muslims are allowed by religion to live out of the income of 'non-believers', and gives an example of Anjema Choudary, who benefits from and 'makes fun of the hard-working British people, who live lives of slaves'. According to another claim, muslims are encouraged to put all their efforts to holy Jihad, which can also be done by creating large families.

A continent that once gave birth to the greatest advances in world civilization is now on the verge of being extinguished by an unmatched foe of religious zealots who are on a quest to establish an Islamic Caliphate over Europe. Now, for the fist time ever, Europe’s Last Stand uncovers the Five Pillars of Islamic Conquest in an extraordinary film that documents the Islamic strategy for dominating Western Europe!

The author describes the situation of muslim people living in Spain in a ironic way. It says that muslims are always complaining as they are victims of prejudices, racism, xenophobia and people hates them because of their religion. The main problem is that this author uses the irony to do it. What basically says is that "if you muslims don't like this country and you are suffering everyday, why are you not leaving to your country?" And in this and other many ways, the author invites all muslim people to leave Spain, don't bother others with their complains and return to their countries.

Josué Estebanez murdered Carlos Palomino stabbing him directly in his heart inside a subway in Madrid. Since Josué was condemned for this crime motivated for his extremist ideology, a group of "patriotic fans" are defending his freedom through different channels as they are sure he is a political prisoner and he did not committed any crime. https://es-la.facebook.com/JosuePaginaOficial They always use the hashtag #JosuéLibertad	S SL, Spain July 22, 2014 at 12:24 pm	hatecrime, hatespeech, antifascist, spain, twitter, facebook
BEWARE: Fix the Family "Cathoilc" Media actually a hate speech organization	http://fixthefamily.com	en-US	Fix the Family claims to be a Catholic media organization, but it is clear from their many blog posts that they are actually a misogynist organization defaming women and promoting views that lead to domestic and sexual abuse. Some examples of their teachings: 1. The man is the head of the house and it is his duty to control his wife and children. A woman's place is in the home; for her to want a career is greedy of her and demonic. 2. A woman has no control over her own body. She cannot use birth control and must have sex whenever her husband wants to. 3. A woman is a "soft delicate flower of a person" who sometimes "screams and hollers" and then "what's a man to do!?" Obviously these are radical and hateful views that taken only slightly farther, can be used to justify all kinds of domestic and sexual violence against women. I support religious freedom of expression (and am religious myself), but this organization should not be allowed to continue publishing what is so obviously dangerous hate speech.

Hate article about refugees	http://www.dailystormer.com/rome-churches-used-as-refugee-centers-for-subhuman-invaders/	en-US	This is the article in full The sickening traitors of the Catholic Church in Rome, led by the Antipope Francis – who recently claimed that Europe should go to Africa and pick up all the poor people and bring them directly to city centers, so the poor dears don’t drown – has begun opening up the churches to be used as refugee centers for hordes of subhuman filth. Washington Post: The Italian coast guard rescued another 293 migrants at sea and brought them to Sicily Tuesday. They join the nearly 60,000 migrants who have arrived in Italy in the first half of 2014, far more than the 42,000 who arrived in all of 2013. Churches in Palermo have emptied out pews to make space for clean cots and community members are pitching in to cook meals and donate goods. Volunteers from the Catholic charity Caritas greet migrant boats at the port with food, clothes, doctors and even psychologists. “We’ve substituted the altar with beds,” said the Rev. Rosario Francolino, who has been coordinating the reception of 700 Africans at a Palermo church since Sunday. “I think it’s the most beautiful Mass the community could celebrate.” Many staying at the churches have survived horrors during their journey to Sicily. Kollycoulibal, a 20-year-old from Mali, said his boat of 49 men filled with water on Sunday morning and he had to swim for two hours until the Italian coast guard arrived. Ten men drowned, including his 16-year-old cousin. Oh sweet mercy. A black person drown. How can the horrors continue to come as this? If they continue to drown, we will run out of black people. And then who would steal the purse? Who would enrich the culture with vibrancy? Who would gang-rape the White women? When all the blacks drown, you’ll wish you had followed the Pope’s advice, and went to Africa and brought them all directly to Europe.

The author has obviously spread a hate speech and aggression towards those citizens of Armenia who have realized their rights to freedom of speech stated by all internal and international laws and expressing their opinions about the members of the Armenian Jury of “Eurovision-2014” (according to those Facebook users the Armenian Jury has had a discriminative attitude towards the Austrian singer Conchita Wurst based on her sexual orientation and gender identity). The author has formed “the black list of the enemies of the Armenian nation” by publishing the links of the Facebook profiles of the latter. The co-workers of the “New Generation” Humanitarian NGO Arman Sahakyan, Grigor Gevorgyan and Hovhannes Mkrtchyan have been targeted as well. On 29/05/2014 in accordance with the above mentioned the co-workers of the “New Generation” Humanitarian NGO have requested the head of the board of “Iravunk Media” LTD. Hayk Babukhanyan to publish a refusal and publicly apologize for dissemination of disinformation and spreading hate speech and intolerance by calling all the employers to fire the “blacklisted citizens”, not to employ them and other discriminative messages (according to the 1087,1 article of the Civic Code and Article 7 of the law on “Mass Media” of Armenia. In connection with this the president of “New Generation” Humanitarian NGO mentioned that the organization will support its co-workers during all litigation processes in the Court in order to achieve social justice and equality for all. - See more at: http://ngngo.net/2014/06/%d5%b0%d5%a5%d6%80%d6%84%d5%b4%d5%a1%d5%b6-%d6%87-%d5%b0%d6%80%d5%a1%d5%ba%d5%a1%d6%80%d5%a1%d5%af%d5%a1%d5%b5%d5%ab%d5%b6-%d5%b6%d5%a5%d6%80%d5%b8%d5%b2%d5%b8%d6%82%d5%a9%d5%b5%d5%a1%d5%b6-%d5%ba/?lang=en#sthash.XqtWefGe.dpuf	Arman Sahakyan, Armenia June 11, 2014 at 11:58 am	lgbt, hate, intolerance, discrimination

Extreme homophobic language aimed at Ireland	https://endzog.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/ireland-land-of-saints-and-scholars-celebrates-revolting-faggot/	en-US	This blog post is an example of extreme homophobia SEE EXAMPLES BELOW A disgusting Irish homosexual who cannot stop publically proclaiming his love of male genitalia admixing with his faeces, has according to the Rothschild-owned newswire AP, “become a celebrated star With millions of fans” in the Jewish-bankster controlled trainwreck rapidly descending into a third-world jungle known as the Irish Republic. It was always understood in Ireland that there were homosexuals and it was never an issue as long as it was kept to themselves, in fact there was very little hostility to them among the general population and Anglo-Irish writer Oscar Wilde’s homosexuality never impinged upon his fame. But since the ‘liberation’ of this group they have, as they have done in every other country, sought to flaunt themselves and their perverted practices in the national eye as much as they possibly could, practically having sex in public infront of children in ‘gay’ parades.

Local Politician Discrimation and hate speech  against Travellers	https://twitter.com/Lazare76/status/452139802075594753	ga-IE	This leaflet was forwarded to constituents in the area this Councillor is seeking election in. She has worked hard to prevent local Travellers (an ethnic minority with similarities to Roma people) from moving into an area. One of the reasons she states for this prevention was that anti social behaviour was already a problem in the area. When it is or not, she made a horrific assumption about Travellers. Ms Higgins' party, Fine Gael, has signed the ENAR Ireland election protocol and promised to discipline politicians in its party who used hate speech. The party have not responded to multiple calls from the public to deal with this issue.

Latvijas Tautas Tribunāls	http://tautastribunals.eu	lv-LV	Blog/forum posts on this site can be directly associated with hate speech. More specifically, they target ethnic groups such as Jews and Russians. Common slogans include mass extermination and labeling these ethnic minorities as 'sub-human' species. Target individuals are often politicians, that supposedly are either Jew, Russian, Communist or any combinations of the above-mentioned, that have allegedly infiltrated key government positions with the sole purpose of extermination of Latvian nation. Content of the blog is written in a variant of Latvian language, that has been poorly written (grammar, style). However, the domain is '.eu', so that the local (Latvian) criminal laws against hate speech might not apply. In my personal opinion, this site has no place on the European internet.

Anti-gay music. 'Same Love - A Response.'	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9KQ4_uH1RA	en-US	I draw attention to three false premises in the track and how they assist a culture of hateful division. This is not a defense of Macklemore's track 'Same Love'. We should also be critical of that. False premise 1: 'People of colour and people who are gay are two antagonistic and separate groups.' Many people of colour are also gay. This misrepresention of reality, presents two separate groups, working to perpetuate division between people and ignores the lives of people of colour who are gay and LBTQ*. False premise 2: 'People who are gay all say 'gay is the new black.'' The statement 'gay is the new black' also pisses off many people who are gay, and many who are both gay and black. Whilst Macklemore's 'Same Love' ignores intersectionality and marginalised continuing black struggle, Bizzle conflates Macklemore with all people who are gay. Macklemore speaks for Macklemore. Characterising people who are gay as people who say this kind of ignorant rubbish is an insult to huge numbers of people. False premise 3: Associating being gay with being a pedophile and/or being sick. This is highly dangerous, deeply insulting and all kinds of false. Sexual violence and abuse of children is *always* about power, domination and control. This is not true of relationships between consenting adults.

Nothing of the sort. We have yet to comply with a whole set of preconditions. Do you know which are they? We have to legalize same-sex marriages, we have provide equal rights to the members of sexual minorities!

High ranking politicians exposed of hate speech on swedish hate site	http://avpixlat.info/	sv-SE	Case of Hate Speech by the Sweedish Democrats all over the media. Swedish democrats have had problems with racism within its elected officials, and the leader of the party has introduced this kind of "no tolerance profile" and two politicians have steped down form their possition and eight are being investigted. Here is an interview with one of the politicians, Marie Stensby, that have been exposed of having expressing hate speech on an online hate news site roughly tranlated "Avpixlat - the un sensored truth". Thousands of previously secret identities on the site's comment fields have been leaked, many of those politicians for the mentioned party. Stensby has been using the nickname "folk culture" on avpixlatand hope to run for parliament in Sweden next year. She referes to muslims as everything from "the invading troops" to "punks" and "swarms of locusts". She continues "A small comfort is that at least locusts move on when the have devoured al that can be eaten where they settle". She is known to have stated "I hope the starve to death" about asylum seeking kids and youth on a hunger strike and "the best for the world would be if sunni and shia muslims just kill each other". Confronted by these comments on the interview she does not take back her comments, but defends herself with "typical for these online sites is that you write things you don't really think through". She runs for parliament either way. On the question "can we have a person that wishes people dead running for parliament elections" she responds, "well, I guess we'll see then." One right wing extremist went to the newspaper who exposed these and threatened that "if you continue writing, I'll be back with a knife". In one of the hate sites exposed by expressen they are threatening certain named journalists of coming to their homes and some are crow funding for a lawsuit. Site is axpixlat.info Picture from interview and with screen dump from her "wish they stave to death"-comment Yes, Lazlo, I have reported it to hate speech watch ;-) http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=no&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dagbladet.no%2F2013%2F12%2F14%2Fnyheter%2Futenriks%2Frasisme%2Fhoyreekstreme%2Fexpressen%2F30836936%2F	Eirik Rise, Norway December 14, 2013 at 11:36 am	racism, islamophobia, asylum, politician, sweden, violence, threats

Hateful speech against an Armenian driver in Russian Public Channel	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu0I9SyLJOU	ru-RU	The video is news reportage of Russian second most popular public channel, which was later, posted, widely shared and commented in YouTube. The title of the video reads “Armenian killer of women and children. […] Russians and Armenians”. It is about a car accident that happened in Moscow lately in a result of which a more than ten people died. The driver was of Armenian origin and citizenship and the news reporter would say it every second while speaking about why the accident happened. The speaker has an obviously rude, hateful and negative emphasis in her speech every time she notes the nationality of the driver, i.e. surname that ends with “yan”, country “Armenia” where the driver comes from, etc. Moreover, she noted about the driver (watch from the minute 1:24) that in the Court “he would not raise his eyes, would “mumble” and refused to testify which is not definitely related to any health conditions of Hrachya Harutyunyan”. With this video the speaker factually “nationalizes” the accident as if it would not happen if the driver had another nationality. It has the aim to show and further to prove the society about the harm that Armenian did to Russians.	Lusine Ghazaryan, Armenia December 8, 2013 at 10:15 pm	racism, russia, nationalism, immigration
Violence Inciting Speech against Iranians	http://haynews.am/hy/1378472909	hy-AM	The article and the comments that follow are discriminatory towards Iranians who come to Armenia. The article describes an incident when a group of Iranian guys who entered the service center of a Telecommunications Company, behaved in a rude, impolite, impudent way with the girls standing next or close to them. They behaved so bad that the security beat the Iranian men. The incident is described in a way as if all Iranians are impolite, clumsy, and “are not worth” coming to Armenia. It is important to note that the basis of the information of this article is an interview carried out with an unknown person, who said, after all, that of course “our guys did it good that decided to beat the Iranians”. The comments that follow support the statements in the article and add more hateful and intolerant statements about Iranians in general!

The news piece also includes an indication of someone's supposed ethnic background in description of a crime, as well as talks about passport checks as "decriminalization" of Moscow thus suggesting criminality of migrants living in the city. The report ends with yet another mention of an "illegal" as it claims involved in the incident at the border.

Hate speech in Ireland against Roma	http://www.irishelection.com/2007/07/roma-gypsies/	en-US	The article itself is fine; Here are some of the comments I feel that the Government have ruined this country. Ireland has become a dumping ground for people who are not prepared to work. It is an very sore point to the majority of Irish people. The Majority of Irish people feel that all Romanian Gypsies are nothing but trouble. All the Scandanavian Countries have now refused to allow these people into their countries. Why is it that Ireland let anyone in? Ireland have to crack down and prevent people with No Visa’s into the Country. It is a known fact that Romanian and Nigerian people have a reputation for fraud, stealing and cheating. We didn’t make it up. I feel it is up to the Government to take a firm stance and tackle this problem once and for all. If the average Romanian is as decent and hardworking as the Polish community then I have no problem with them. The Romanian Gypsies are different. They have no intention of working here. They come here with a chip on their shoulders. All they intend to do is beg and claim whatever social welfare is on offer. The Government is right to deport them. This Country is fast becoming the social welfare office of Europe.When did we sign up for this? I dont remember reading anything in any of the treaties to suggest we will accept people without any background check. How many rapists and murderers have we taken in? We have enough of our own. I have seen how the Gypsyes operate and it is not plesant. The big fat Gypsy men send their wives and daughters out to beg,they then patrole the area and take any money they get. I find it a refreshing that native people in all the industrailized countries are finally standing tall and demanding that immigrants and guests adhere to the rule of law and decency as a requirement to remain. The problem is world-wide and two-fold. First, you have governments eager to unload their lower-class dregs of society onto their neighbors. Second, you have the liberal do-gooders who recklessly allow the influx. The citizens and the new arrivals alike are left to sort out the mess. It’s time for nationalism to arise and put a stop to countries exporting their problems to others. Im in Kent,and we have the same problems with the filthy dirty rude ignorant people liveing in caravans,big cars,no tax, they pay no nat insurance,they invade your space,throw rubbish out of the caravan windows,shit on the footpaths,they are scum and should be all loaded up and shipped off to Afganistan,where they can do what they like. Zeitgeist, what about if you dont like it fuckoff home? we dont fucking want you here anyway you god damned locust, your people are a curse on society of the world, the Roma scum emigrated froom india about a thousand years ago, what about they all fuckoff back to india and stop bleeding my beautiful contry dry? home with you, you fucking welfare tourist. These Romanian gypsies are a disgrace. Walking down Dublin anyday one has to put up with a barrage of irritating gypsies pestering me for money. I was in my local post office today and a dirty gypsy hands in her welfare card and received the guts of 700euro or so in handouts. The other day a gypsy came into my local shop and tried to buy cigarettes with a 200euro note! No idea what her motive was but I doubt it was because she had nothing smaller. Bet the fucker didnt work for it. They should all be deported the fuckers. Ive just moved back to Tralee Town after living in the uk since 1995, I cannot for the life of me believe all the foreigners on benefits and the amount of Romanian Gypsies begging around the town where i grew up, Dublin is bad also. WHAT IS GONE WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY??????????? where did all these beggars and benefits parasites come from???? I have relations in new Housing estates which they have paid 200k for their houses and then Assylum seekers are renting next door on free rent allowance and dole. NO WONDER THE COUNTRY IS GONE THE WAY IT IS AND WE ARE MILLIONS IN DEBT !!!!!!!!!!! THIS COUNRTY IS GETTING WORSE THAN THE UK ………. with all the LEECHES COMING OVER HERE …… WAKE UP IRELAND !!! Zeitgeist, Mark is right, if you dont like it here fuck off back to where you came from, no one asked you to come here. Gypsies are the scourge of Europe and are worse than cockroaches, Hitler should have finished the vermin off, unfortunatley he missed a few and now they have spread like wild fire. they once tried to steal from me as i was using an atm, however they did not succeed, if i ever have an encounter like that with a gypsy again i will be up for murder because i will fucking kill one of them. I dont care who comes to this country as long as they are willing to make an effort, eg work, integrate, learn english etc, not fucking beg and steal at every opportunity. Those bastards are lucky i’m not running the show because they would ALL!!!!! be on the 1st plane outta here back to where they came from, or better still just burn em all. haha I had 15 Roma gypsies living next door to me for FREE.The house was paid for by the welfare.It was hell on earth.screaming and shouting day and night then things started to disappear from my garden.We finally got the landlord to get them out.So i think they should all be put on a plane and sent back to eastern Europe where they all have houses. @ Anita, You are right and i totally agree, we should burn all them also, they( drug dealers etc )serve no purpose in life but to harm others. They should be shot, the whole lot of them. The junkies should not be given any welfare, in fact no one who is found to be unwilling to look for work should be given nothing. Our welfare system is too generous and we need to sort it out. I have nothing against immigrants, my wife is one, but i do have a problem with people coming here for the sole purpose of claiming benefits, begging, stealing etc etc. Why do so many people get so pissed off when someone points out the fact that there are many people here for the wrong reasons? Anyone who says something is a nazi or racist etc, that is bullshit. Let the country be to those spineless liberal bastards and we will see in 20yrs time just how wonderful our county is, we are on the way to becoming another UK, which in my opinion is almost beyond repair. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvwDgBHpo0&feature=related nostalgic momments..those were the days…hope will see some more anytime soon. Imagine a world without gypsies….how nice would that be. There’s a plot i heard from an extremist group to inject them on the street…they become sterile and in a space of 2-3 years,they could die…woaw…that’s good news.

Zhen Dong Zhao kicked the man to death after he had refused to pay in full for a 70 cent phone call. Zhao (36), a Chinese man with an address at Jervis Street in Dublin, had pleaded not guilty to murdering the 40-year-old man on May 20, 2011. However, he admitted kicking the father of two a number of times outside his 24-hour shop, e-Times, on Dublin's Wellington Quay. Noel Fegan was originally from Finglas, but the reformed drug addict had been living in Aughrim Street. He had gone into the shop to phone his 11-year-old daughter, from whom he had received a 'call me' text. His daughter testified that she spoke to her father for a minute and a half. However, Mr Fegan told Zhao he did not get through. Full Story Here Vile Polish Immigrant masturbated while rape victim testified in court By Conor Gallagher and Claire O’SullivanA RAPIST who was jailed for 15 years on Tuesday masturbated in court while his victim gave her evidence, it has emerged. Przemyslaw Jakubowski ambushed his 30-year-old victim as she was running errands in the Cork town of Kanturk. He dragged her into the cubicle of a public toilet where he subjected her to more than half an hour of sexual violence before fleeing. Jakbowski, who also has a conviction in his native Poland for attempted rape, was wearing women’s underwear during the attack which was later found in his home. It has emerged that he began to masturbate in the dock during his trial last May when the woman got in the witness box and recounted the details of the assault. The entire courtroom was unaware what was happening except for Jakbowski’s Polish translator. The translator was sitting beside him at the time and later reported it to the prison guards. Neither the judge nor jury was made aware of the incident. The next day a new translator was found for the trial. Jakubowski exhibited bizarre behaviour throughout the 12-day trial. Full Story HERE. DEGENERATE CHINESE IMMIGRANT SENTENCED OVER SEXUAL ASSAULT OF IRISH TEENAGE GIRL A 34-year old man who sexually assaulted a teenage girl who was working for him has been given a nine-year jail sentence at the Central Criminal Court. Three years of the sentence were suspended. Chun Ming Chen of Oakfield Close, Glanmire, Co Cork, had pleaded guilty to 16 counts of having sexual intercourse with the girl when she was 16 and nine counts of sexually assaulting her. Chen, who is also known as Jimmy, runs Ming's Chinese restaurant in Glanmire. The Central Criminal Court was told he began sexually assaulting the girl in late 2007 after she took a part-time job with him when she was 14-years-old. The assaults went on for almost three years and got progressively more serious, until the girl told her mother and made a complaint to gardaí. Chen was arrested and charged and in May pleaded guilty to 16 counts of having sexual intercourse with the girl and nine counts of sexual assault. Full Story HERE.

The system – which provides shelter for up to 4,600 asylum seekers across 34 centres – has been criticised by campaigners for providing sub-standard accommodation. The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), the State body responsible for accommodation says all companies involved go through a tendering process and are contractually obliged to have valid, current tax clearance certificates.Most such firms are involved in hospitality or catering. In recent years, several have become unlimited companies, and are thus not obliged to provide details of their accounts. Official figures show that Mosney, in Co Meath, has been paid about €101 million for accommodating asylum seekers at the former Butlin’s holiday resort since the direct provision system began. Its main shareholder is listed as El Molino Hotels Ltd. The main owner of El Molino is Sonning Unlimited, based in the Isle of Man. Full Story Here. Swedish Teen Gang raped by Muslim thugs. Muslims Earn Sweden the Title of “Rape Capital of the World” After thinking over the question for five minutes, you might come up with South Africa or some other third world country as your answer. However, the real answer might shock you. Who has the highest number of rapes in the world? The title sadly goes to Sweden, which now sees one out of every four Swedish women being the victim of rape. Is this the result of the rapid influx of Muslim immigrants who continue to form a larger percentage of the Swedish population? With Muslims represented in as many as 77 percent of the rape cases and a major increase in rape cases paralleling a major increase in Muslim immigration, the wages of Muslim immigration are proving to be a sexual assault epidemic by a misogynistic ideology. The escalation of rape in Sweden is so bad that in July of last year there were an average of five rapes a day reported in Stockholm. Think about that for a minute; five women being raped a day in a modern civilized city. This isn’t Afghanistan or Mexico we’re talking about; it’s Sweden. Full Story Here.

DEPRAVED MUSLIM ANIMAL AND HIS EQUALLY DEPRAVED WIFE. UK: DEPRAVED MUSLIM IMMIGRANT KEPT MUTE SEX-SLAVE GIRL (10) IN HIS CELLAR Cahal Milmo – 17 October 2013 A pensioner who trafficked a 10-year-old deaf and mute orphan into Britain, keeping her in his cellar to claim benefits, was convicted yesterday of repeatedly raping the girl. Ilyas Ashar (84) was found guilty of 13 counts of rape against the girl, who is now in her 20s, after she was kept at the home he shared with his wife Tallat in Eccles, Salford, and made to sleep in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar. The jury at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that the girl, an orphan from Pakistan who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, was beaten and slapped as well as being forced to work for Ashar and his family and friends in virtual slavery as a domestic servant. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language following her accidental discovery in 2009 by Trading Standards officers who had come to the couple's house to investigate possible illegal activities. Ashar used his victim to satisfy his sexual desires as well as enlisting his wife to use the girl's details to steal more than £30,000 (€35,000) in benefits and setting up several bank accounts in her name. Two female jurors wept as the guilty verdicts were delivered against Ashar, who was warned by Judge Peter Lakin to expect a "substantial prison sentence". The judge said he was excusing the jurors of further jury service for a decade after hearing traumatic evidence. Ashar had been convicted at an earlier trial of two counts of trafficking a person into the UK for exploitation and three counts relating to the fraudulent obtaining of benefits. Tallat Ashar (68) and the couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar (46) were also found guilty at the previous trial of benefit fraud charges. Full Story Here.

Black Immigrantaccused of daylight baseball attack on fellow black immigrant fails to win bail 18 October 2013 A MAN has failed to secure his release from custody after being refused bail in connection with an incident in which he allegedly hit another man over the head with a baseball bat in broad daylight. Jooda Akanbi (37), who is originally from Nigeria but has been living Swords, Co Dublin, for some years, is charged with assault occasioning harm to Taiwo Jamani (45). It is alleged that during a row on Main Street, Swords, on October 10, Mr Jamani was struck with a baseball bat. He was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition. His lawyers applied for bail in Cloverhill District Court last Tuesday but this was refused by Judge Grainne Malone. They asked the High Court to release him on grounds that he is being unlawfully held in breach of his (Article 40.4.2) constitutional rights. They claimed District Judge Malone's refusal was not in accordance with fair procedures and was based on hearsay evidence in relation to alleged threats made to a witness.

The family of a schoolgirl stabbed to death by a criminal with history of mental health problems have demanded answers after it emerged the killer was allowed out on the streets unsupervised. Phillip Simelane, 23, today pleaded guilty to the killing of 16-year-old Christina Edkins in a random attack on a bus in Birmingham city centre. He admitted a charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Questions are now being asked as to why Simelane was not being monitored following his release from prison where mental health experts had placed warning "markers" about his behaviour on his file. Christina, a pupil at Leasowes High School in Halesowen, was pronounced dead at the scene after being stabbed in the chest on the upper deck of a bus at about 7.30am on March 7. Her parents and siblings said the senselessness of the crime had made their grief that much harder to bear on top of the loss of the schoolgirl, just two weeks after her 16th birthday. Jason and Kathleen Edkins, and Christina's brother Ryan and sister Joanne, also made it clear that questions remain over why Simelane had not been supervised after his release from jail at the end of 2012. Her great uncle Chris Melia added that if 23-year-old Simelane had been properly monitored after his release, the attack on the top deck of the No 9 bus "wouldn't have happened". Full Story Here.

A Bulgarian book for students published online containing homophobic and racist statements	http://www.srzi.bg/documents/Profilaktika/Decata_i_uchilishteto/Zdravna_azbuka.pdf	bg-BG	This is a textbook called "Alphabet of Health" (Здравна азбука) seems to be approved by the Ministry of education of Bulgaria in 2009. The author, Totko Naydenov, judges the homosexual people telling that they have a mental disease, they live unhappy, that big number of them have AIDS disease (just because they are homosexual!), telling that God does not accept homosexual people and that big number of the homosexual people are pedophiles. The author goes even so far that states that homosexual practices are widely spread in the monasteries of today! The author states that in Bulgaria mostly the roma people have the syphilis disease. The author insults the drug-addicted people telling that they are the tragedy of the society and they all die young. The author states that gay-prides are made by gay people who have complexes and that the gay prides are effrontery. The text is much stronger in Bulgarian and much more offensive than the summary I presented here. Please, read here citations in Bulgarian: Напоследък сифилисът зачести и у нас – средногодишно заболяват вече над 600 български граждани, предимно от по-мургавия контингент. Особено опасно е аналното сексуално сношение, затова преобладаващата част от спинозните хора са педерасти. Известно е, че най-засегнат е светът на изкуството, предимно балетистите и фигуристите на лед – мнозина от тях са педерасти. ХИВ е причина за смърт в над 60% от смъртните случаи на хората от 25 до 44 години (най-творческата възраст!) в Париж. Корифеят на балетното изкуство Рудолф Нуреев бе покосен от него. Както и интимният му приятел, непрежалимият гений Фреди Меркюри ХОМОСЕКСУАЛИЗМЪТ (педерастия – при мъжете; лесбийство, сафизъм – при жените) е бил както възхваляван от повечето народи и религии, така и възхваляван още от древността. Причината за отрицанието е проста: от тази противоестествена, объркана, “обратна” любов обществото и владетелите нямат полза: тя е стерилна, лишена от най-великото й призвание - да създава Дете, да посява Живот. Темата за педерастията е много деликатна не само защото от 3 до 16% (!) от мъжете в различните страни са съпричастни към този вид са съпричастни към този вид полово общуване или направо страдат от тази своя обреченост. (Именно страдат – защото почти всички педерасти се чувства дълбоко нещастни и желаят да се лекуват, особено в началото на своето сексуално проявление, наричано от самите тях деликатно “нещо по-различно” или “двойно чувство”.) Проблеми с признаването на педерастите за хора с равни права с всички останали си имаше и бившият президент Клинтън: в Конгреса така и не приеха предложението му да им се позволява за служат в армията. Конфузно е наистина: как така ще въведеш сред безброй мъже други “мъже”, всъщност жени в манталитета и поведението си, зажаднели за своя си “обратен” секс”: няма ли по този начин армията да се разложи? Разгледана в медицинската й същност, педерастията е като повечето болестни състояния вродена и придобита. (Почти няма нов затворник, особено ако е съвсем млад и слабоват, който да не е бил изнасилван от закоравелите престъпници-съкилийници...) Най-накрая педерастията е и симптоматична у немалко психопати – шизофреници или манийно болни. Психиатрите наричат педерастията още: вродена природна наклонност, биологично явление, сексопатия, девиация (отклонение), психична деформация. Изобщо – нищо ласкаво или положително, нищо насърчаващо, одобрително... БОГ ОТРИЧА ПЕДЕРАСТИЯТА! Вярно, Бог е Любов – но не и в обратните й измерения. Той се отвръща с погнуса от педерастията и повелява тя да бъде безмилостно преследвана, като непростим грях: “Жена да не носи мъжко облекло, нито мъж да се облича в женска дреха, понеже всички, които правят това, са мерзост за Господа, твоя Бог” – пише във Второзаконието, Стария Завет. (Въпреки светите писания обаче педерастията и до днес широко се прилага в манастирите...) Да, Бог е благословил Любовта само между разнородните полове и останалото е недоразумение на Природата Виновни ли са, че са се родили малко по-други, с тяло на мъж, а с душа на жена? Някои педерасти си намират отдушник: вглъбяват се в науката, в изкуството, в професията си. Далеч не всички от тях са инициативни и настоятелни до нахалство в търсене на партньор от своя пол. Но има и свръхактивни педерасти: според американските лекари половината от тях в “столицата” им Сан Франциско са носители на ХИВ-вируса, защото са сменяли безогледно, настървено и без ползване напредпазни средства партньорите си – средно по 100 годишно, т. е. по 1 нов на всеки 3 дни... Отблъскващото при хомосексуалистите е престъпната педофилия, която немалко от тях практикуват, както и комплексарството им, което те се опитват да прикрият пред обществото чрез т. нар. “гей-паради”. Това е с нищо непредизвикана наглост и провокативност от страна на една малцинствена сексуална прослойка. Да се възхвалява и по този начин – индиректно да се препоръчва непродуктивното хомосексуално общуване на околните, и особено – на децата, неволно наблюдаващи тезидемонстрации, е абсолютно неприемливо и обижда българските мъже и бащи. Никой няма право да натрапва и пропагандира другиму своя сексуален избор и предпочитания! Особено недопустими и гнусни са напоследък зачестилите в някои предимно скандинавски страни манифестации, кросове, колоездачни пробези и пр. на съвършено голи хора; според нас по своята същност те представляват откровен ексхибиционизъм, което е подсъдно деяние, но бива легализирано от наивните, лесно подвеждащи се кметове, които им дават разрешения, от криворазбран страх после да не бъдат упрекнати в недемократичност и нетолерантност. СПИН. А сега – внимание! Това е болестта, която уби Любовта, проклятието й, пратено от полуделите Богове. Как се е появил страшният му неумолим вирус, защо и откъде – мутант на космическите лъчения, злощастен лабораторен опит ли е той – или изчадие на сатаната? Болният човек няма сили дори да се изправи в леглото си; накрая той представлява съсухрено безпомощно вързопче кожа и кости, подобен на нещастниците от фашистките концлагери За отбелязване е, все пак, че хомосексуалистите загиват твърде бързо след първите симптоми (а “обратните” мъже са 75% от развилите болестта в САЩ и Западна Европа). ЛЕСБИЙСТВОТО (сафизмът) е хомосексуално поведение между жени; то не е така масово низвергнато в обществото, както педерастията, но все пак не е твърде “редовна” любов най-вече поради същата причина: не може да роди Плод, да създаде Дете, да възпроизведе човешкия род. Това обаче, с което не бива да се съгласяваме, е неистовото желание на някои от тях да прокламират своята “обратна” чувственост и дори да я натрапват и агитират на обществото, което, все пак, е предимствено хетеросексуално (чрез грозните им, отблъскващи гей-паради, които са с нищо непредизвикано предизвикателство към различното от тях, преобладаващо хетеросексуално общество). За най-голямата прелюбодейка-нимфоманка в историята се смята Юлия, дъщерята на император Октавиан Август. Тя е канела в леглото си абсолютно всеки мъж, когото срещне в Рим – независимо от вида, възрастта и цвета на кожата му; легендата й приписва 80 000 партньори. (Интересно, какъв ли развъдник на зарази е била тази хетера…) АНОРЕКСИЯ Явно някои момичета мислят, че стават по-привлекателни, ако заприличат на сенки и ребрата им се броят, а краката и ръцете заприличат на клечки; освен че е грозно и отблъскващо, това може да бъде и смъртоносно! Все още в някои училищни бюфети се предлагат абсолютно недопустими и вредни както за зъбите, така и за целия организъм (вече подчертахме, че водят до затлъстяване!) изделия като бонбони, марципани, снакс, чипс, газирани и подсладени напитки. Интелигентните ученици просто не ги купуват и консумират. Почти няма отказал се хероинов наркоман (макар че всички от тях го желаят неистово и дълбоко съжаляват, задето са започнали това опасно и фатално “развлечение”); тези хора са нещастници – с много малко изключения те умират млади, в адски мъки, презрени и отбягвани от обществото, преживе оплаквани от близките си, неизвървяли житейския си път, предопределен им от Господа, несъздали деца и блага - заради което са дошли на Белия Свят. И защото възрастен наркоман няма – всички умират млади и съсипани от безразсъдството си. Наркоманите не проявяват интерес към нищо край себе си, те губят сексуалните сижелания, менструалният цикъл на момичетата е нарушен. Личността деградира като при шизофрениците! Пред вас е душевен инвалид, непълноценна личност, бреме и трагедия за обществото, непоносима мъка за семейството, един млад, достоен само за окайване човек, който сам си е изкопал гроба и влиза в него пред очите на всички… Дори и да ви е любопитно, дори и да ви увещават най-добрите ви приятели (които тогава всъщност ви стават врагове, зложелатели и гробокопачи), дори и с риск да ви се присмиват и да ви “обвиняват” в малодушие и страхливост – и ако искате да живеете дълго и щастливо; - да се радвате до дълбока старост на прекрасния Бял Свят, на дарения ви от Бога Живот; - да обичате и вас да ви обичат, да си имате щастлив дом и свои дечица – НЕ ЗАПОЧВАЙТЕ, НЕ ЗАПОЧВАЙТЕ, НЕ ЗАПОЧВАЙТЕ!!! Иначе ще умрете млади, грозни и жалки! А ние толкова много ви обичаме! Нали не искате сами да се отречете от слънцето, вятъра и Любовта – и да влизате в черната земя в самото начало на очакващия ви прекрасен и светъл житейски път!? Какво предпочитате – слънцето, птичките и Любовта Тук, Горе или червеите, калта и мрака Там, Долу? “НЕ” НА НАРКОТИЦИТЕ – ОЗНАЧАВА “ДА!” НА ЖИВОТА! ЖИВЕЙТЕ, надежда и радост наша, скъпи дечица на Майка БЪЛГАРИЯ!!! "	Petar Georgiev, Bulgaria September 21, 2013 at 3:47 pm	homophobia, racism, bulgaria, gaypride, nationalism

An Albanian mockery site promoting Serb organ trafficking	http://yellowhousealbania.com/	en-US	An Albanian website called "yellowhousealbania.com" is promoting Serb organ trafficking. Organ theft in Kosovo (sometimes also known as the "yellow house" case) refers to organ harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of "disappeared" people, for which 5 people so far have been convicted in the case involving an elaborate organ trafficking network, and other cases are under investigation. The victims are believed to be mostly ethnic Serbs of Kosovo, killed by perpetrators with strong links to elements of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1999. The men were taken to a makeshift clinic near Tirana, Albania, where they were shot in the head and then had their organs removed. In 2010, a report by Swiss prosecutor Dick Marty to the Council of Europe (CoE) uncovered "credible, convergent indications" of an illegal trade in human organs going back over a decade,including the deaths of a "handful" of Serb captives killed for this purpose. The case is being investigated by the authorities, as they claim that there is no enough evidence so far. This website promotes Serb organ trafficking in a mockery way, with a slogan "Don`t miss our new collection of Serbs". They posted even an Albanian girl who says that her puppy had defective lungs and in the Yellow House Albania they were replaced by Serbian ones! They also mention Dick Marty, Vuk Jeremic and Carla del Ponte as customers, who are said to have had brain transplantations, replaced with swine tissue in Jeremic`s case.

Albanian Roma	http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ndal-gjuhes-ofenduese-ndaj-rom%C3%ABve-ne-media.html	sq-AL	In the recent days some daily newspapers in Albania have used a negative and derogatory language towards Roma community living in the country. This is not the first time that such negative and unacceptable language against our community finds space in the Albanian media. Certain words such as “Cigan”, “Gabi” which represent a very negative connotation have been present in several occasions in the Albanian media. The use of certain language in the media by journalists representing a negative, disdainful and exclusion meaning over Roma is both wrong and unjust. Roma community has lived in Albania for centuries and represents an important cultural and human treasure to the Albanian society. The Roma civil society organizations in Albania together with Roma youth have initiated a campaign which aims to create awareness within the traditional and social media in order to stop the negative and disdainful language towards Roma. The use of such language harms at the same time our community and further discourages the initiatives of public institutions and civil society to advance Roma inclusion as basic right and an imperative for the progress of the Albanian society. Disdainful language hurts! Stop negative speech! Stop the despising and offensive language in the media against Roma! The aim of this petition is to disseminate the message that negative language towards Roma is a language against a healthy, just and prosperous society. In case you agree with the above lines, please sign this petition, disseminate it and make its message and logo your Facebook profile photo for a day. Your contribution keeps the negative language against Roma away from the Albanian media.

Italian right-wing politician proposes that Roma residing in irregular camps be sent "back home" in trains	http://tv.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/03/30/torino-lega-nord-fondi-pubblici-per-nomadi-rispediamoli-coi-treni-a-casa-loro/226721/?fb_action_ids=10151540151894074&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map={%2210151540151894074%22%3A319495708179705}&action_type_map={%2210151540151894074%22%3A%22og.likes%22}&action_ref_map=[]	it-IT	This is an intervention by an Italian right-wing politician of Lega Nord. He is commenting on the situation in 5 "nomad" (in Italy, Roma people are also often referred to with this name, even though it is creating many misunderstandings). He is proposing that these people be sent back home in trains. Literally, he is saying "Let's take three trains and send them back home". He is from the Piedmont Regional Council, so he is saying this as a public person.	Mara Georgescu, France March 30, 2013 at 3:41 pm	roma, antigypsyism, antiroma
The present situation of the Rromani people	http://worldrroma.blogspot.com.br/p/no-hate-speec.html	en-US	The situation of all the Rroma living around Europe is similar in many aspects, but there are some particularities that make their situations quite different, depending on the countries in which they live.

The Sabina Elena case	http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sabina-Elena/433149636772903?fref=ts	ro-RO	The page was launched on the 21st of March as a hotbed of hate speech, following the Sabina Elena case. A girl in the romanian town of Covasna provoked outrage from here school after appering in romanian flag clothing, on the 15th of March in a hungarian majority school (the date is a hungarian national holiday). Allthough the girl recognised the act as being a provocation against here hungarian collegues, the romanian media picked it up as an act of repression against romanians, by the hungarian minority.

Hate speech video - denial of genocide	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QEVggwKPDY&list=UUPenmcm7cA5dwEGxCJrUopw&index=1&feature=plcp	tr-TR	What the video says? The video entitled “Apo’s mother :) – Apo was an Armenian” starts with these words: “ATTENTION!! WE CERTAINLY DO NOT RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS VIDEO AFTER MEALS. BECAUSE YOU MAY THROW UP!!!.” IN THE UPCOMING PHOTO YOU SEE BITCH LEYLA KISSING A WOMAN’S HAND. THAT WOMAN IS APO’S MOTHER : ) IN OTHER WORDS A FUCKING ARMENIAN : ) WHAT’S THE REAL NAME OF APO? ARTIN AGOPYAN (*a typical Armenian name) Do you know who discovered this? A martyr’s father who spoke during a trial that took place in 1999. He said to Apo: “You are not Kurdish, you are Armenian! Now I am talking in Kurdish with you, if you are a Kurd, then answer me in Kurdish!”. Of course he couldn’t recieve any answers. Apo, a so called Kurd, claimed that he would liberate the Kurds and then killed more Kurds then Turks, gave trainings in Turkish in the guerilla camps. Artin Agopyan with the nickname Abdullah Öcalan. In reality he was an Armenian and he did not know Kurdish!.. IN this way, someone shouted at the murderer’s face that he was in fact an Armenian. -- This video employs hate speech because it is a complete lie which serves to deny the rights of Kurds while inciting hatred and hostility against Armenians who have always been the scapegoats of this country. The aim is to “justify hatred” against Armenians by putting the blame of the ongoing terror in the country (which actually resulted from the Turkish state’s oppression of Kurds) on a very vulnerable minority group who frequently become the targets of hate crimes. Furthermore, the word “Armenian” itself is used as an insult which further promotes hatred against the Armenian community.

Does gypsy crime exist in Hungary?	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5NeaT8Afz0	en-US	This is in Hungarian but subtitled in English. The comments are in English. A man, who claims himself gypsy is explaining that gypsy crime exist and supports with facts. He explains how it should be prevented. Many of his ideas may make sense in terms of prevention, the 'only' mistake he makes is that he uses the term 'gypsies' instead of criminals, which of course welcomed by many people. When reading/listening this speech one can easily fall in the same trap. Very dangeouros! And look at the comments. They are even stronger.	Community Manager, Hungary March 21, 2013 at 3:10 pm	gypsy
